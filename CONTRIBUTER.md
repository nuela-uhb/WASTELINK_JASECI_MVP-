CONTRIBUTING GUIDELINES

Welcome to the WasteLink MVP project.
To keep the repo clean and organized, please follow these rules:



1. Branching Structure

Always create a new branch from main

Use this naming format:
feature/<task-name>
fix/<bug-name>


Examples:

feature/request-pickup

fix/frontend-null-response





2. Commits

Use clean, small commits.
Commit message format:

feat: added resident request action
fix: resolved null response from backend
docs: updated wireframes
refactor: cleaned up code structure




3. Working With Issues

Each task MUST be linked to a GitHub Issue

After completing a task, comment under the issue:
“Completed, PR linked below.”

Close issue only after PR is approved & merged





4. Pull Requests

When opening a PR:

Checklist:

[ ] Title is clear

[ ] Task issue linked

[ ] Code runs successfully

[ ] No unused files

[ ] Describe what you built

[ ] Request review from teammate





5. Code Style

Keep functions small & readable

Write comments for important logic

Follow folder structure

No pushing directly to main





6. Documentation

Update /docs every time you build a feature

Add diagrams, screenshots, or flow charts if needed
